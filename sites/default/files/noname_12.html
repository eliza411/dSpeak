Hmm, I wonder what made him think that? You are a volunteer admin, not a site admin, so you can&#39;t add new people or assign permissions. <br><br>She exists (mcrea_k) and is already set up with the permission to view volunteers, but she doesn&#39;t have volunteer admin permissions. Is that what she needs? I can give that to her in half a second. <br>

<br>If you&#39;d like me to set you up to manage the permissions for the volunteer database and write directions, I&#39;d be glad to. It would take about an hour to make it something I can delegate, but I don&#39;t have any idea who&#39;s billing whom for what so I don&#39;t want to just forge ahead unless someone is sure that it&#39;s worth it. <br>

I am sooo ready for a long weekend! :)<br><br>Hey, so I looked and can&#39;t figure out how to give our new background check lady her own account. Troy said it was set up so that I can, but not if I can&#39;t figure out how! So, do you have brief instructions on how to do that? Or, do you need to do it? If you do, the gal&#39;s name is Katie McRae and she&#39;s in the system. <br>
