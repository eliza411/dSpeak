This is a weird one. I applied for an account and the process went just fine.<br><br>When I look at the URL in the e-mail you sent, it is malformed (a period at the end of <a href="http://www.ofj.org">www.ofj.org</a> that bypasses the ssl cert, and then the encoded character in the user name).<br>

<br>Will you forward the e-mail you received notice for melissa_test (which I created a few minutes ago and already deleted).<br>
