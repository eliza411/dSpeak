<html><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>One thing more you might look at if I'm able to make it make sense. Someone who is both editor and one of the taxonomy groups, say group - editor - communications, should be able to view and edit a node that's been saved &nbsp;in that group's term, say Department/Project Owner Communications. This works properly when the node is published, but not when it is unpublished. Devel node access shows that they should have edit privilege, but they don't.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Sent from my mobile device</div><div><br>On Sep 30, 2010, at 10:30 PM, Jon Duell &lt;<a href="mailto:duellj@gmail.com">duellj@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></div><div></div><blockquote type="cite"><div><div><div>Thanks Melissa, I'll tackle those remaining issues tomorrow.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>Jon<br><br>On Sep 30, 2010, at 6:54 PM, Melissa Anderson &lt;<a href="mailto:melissa@incitedev.com"></a><a href="mailto:melissa@incitedev.com"><a href="mailto:melissa@incitedev.com">melissa@incitedev.com</a></a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></div><div></div><blockquote type="cite"><div>Let's get you started then :)<br><br>It was great to see you, too.
