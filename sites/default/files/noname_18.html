Hi Melissa,<br>
 <br>
They look great!  This is what I would like/need to do now.<br>
 <br>
1.  Check in with Bob about having Aaron complete the work.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine.<br>
 <br>
2.  Talk to you about the best way to handle 1974 - 1997.  We DO have tapes/CDs for most of these.  I&#39;m thinking the following:<br>
  a.  break them apart into years (at least for the earlier years) since we didn&#39;t put on as many programs then.  I&#39;ll have to check.<br>
  b.  Break them apart into specific programs.  I would then have someone enter their description into Word from our old brochures, and then they could be cut and paste into the correct body fields.  But this would be LOW priority.<br>



 <br>
3.  We&#39;re thinking about getting rid of the tapes all together, and the CDs do contain both lecture and workshop, so the cross referencing works okay from that standpoint.  The issue is with how they are listed in the library catalog.  I can&#39;t remember what we said we would do about this for the future.  I&#39;ll have to find my notes and get back to you on it.<br>



 <br>
4.  The only bug-a-boo (if you&#39;ll forgive the expression) is that we&#39;ll probably only video-stream the lectures, since the workshops often have sensitive material.  But our link could say &quot;Listen to the lecture.&quot;  In the case where it&#39;s okay to listen to the workshop, the link could say &quot;Listen to the lecture and workshop.  <br>


<br>
I&#39;m off for a bit.  Hope what I&#39;ve written here helps answer some of your questions below.<br>
 <br>

<div></div><div><br><br>Hi Judi,<br><br>I set Aaron up with just enough permissions to split apart the archives for now: See <a href="http://www.ofj.org/speakers/Spring+2008" target="_blank">http://www.ofj.org/speakers/Spring+2008</a><br>


<br>It looks to me like we have the years 1998 - 2007 to move, so we&#39;re looking at $225 to cut them apart, set their authorship dates, publish them, cross-reference them with reading lists, and update the index. This will put them in the right format to attach the mp3 files when the time comes. <br>


<br>What about 1974 - 1997? (I wouldn&#39;t worry about these unless (or until) there are MP3 files for the lectures.)<br><br>I am thinking about how the Event Announcement and Library Item will fit together. When we get to working on combining the records for the CD (MP3s), we&#39;ll be cross-referencing the Event Announcement so people can see the teaser (which is the Lecture and Workshop text. They&#39;re not currently entered in a way that you can separate one from another) as part of the library item. That should allow us to cross-reference any attached MP3 files if we want to provide a link from the Library Item to the streaming file.<br>


<br>We&#39;ll definitely want to talk about this structure before we consolidate the records for the CD (MP3s). Lets talk before I leave for Ashland about their priority.<br><br>Let me know if you&#39;d like us to go ahead with the Archive work.<br>
